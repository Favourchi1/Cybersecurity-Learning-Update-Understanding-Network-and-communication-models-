# Cybersecurity Learning Update: Understanding Networks & Communication Models

## Summary
Today’s focus was on learning the **fundamentals of networking**—a foundational area in cybersecurity.

## What I Learned

### What is a Network?
A **network** is a group of connected devices that can share data and resources. I explored the two main types of networks:

- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Covers a small area like a home, office, or building.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Spans a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs.

---

### Essential Network Devices
These devices play key roles in building and securing a network:

-  **Firewall** – Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic.
-  **Server** – Provides services/resources to other computers.
-  **Router** – Connects different networks and directs data.
-  **Hub** – Basic device for connecting multiple computers (broadcasts to all).
-  **Switch** – Connects devices and filters data to the correct destination.
-  **Modem** – Converts digital data to analog signals and vice versa.

##  Network Communication Protocols

###  TCP/IP Model
I learned about the **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)** model—a 4-layer framework used to transmit data across networks:

1. **Network Access Layer** – Deals with physical transmission (e.g., Ethernet).
2. **Internet Layer** – Manages IP addressing and routing.
3. **Transport Layer** – Ensures reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP).
4. **Application Layer** – Interfaces with end-user applications (HTTP, FTP, etc.).

### OSI Model
I also explored the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model—a 7-layer standard used for understanding how data flows across networks:

1. **Physical** – Cables, switches, and hardware.
2. **Data Link** – MAC addresses and switching.
3. **Network** – IP addressing and routing.
4. **Transport** – End-to-end connections (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session** – Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation** – Data formatting and encryption.
7. **Application** – Interfaces directly with user applications.

## Cybersecurity Relevance

Understanding these models and components is **critical for detecting vulnerabilities**, securing data in motion, and protecting network infrastructure from threats.

## Final Thoughts

This session gave me a solid foundation in networking concepts from a cybersecurity perspective. I'm excited to keep learning and building stronger technical knowledge as I grow in this field!
